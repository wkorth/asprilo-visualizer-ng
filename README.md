## About

This is the repository for an eventual successor to the current asprilo-visualizer.
It can be installed via running the command:

```bash
conda install -c wkorth asprilo-visualizer-ng
```

This Project is still in an early stage of development and in no way finished.
Just like this readme, which will be expanded soon.
